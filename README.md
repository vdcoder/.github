# Hi, Iâ€™m Victor â€” Applied AI Engineer / Senior Software Engineer

20+ years building reliable systems (C/C++/C#/Python/TS) and the last few focused on **applied LLMs**:
- **RAG + SQL agents** for HR/ERP-style data
- **LoRA fine-tuning** on 7â€“8B models (RTX 12GB)
- **Evaluation harnesses** for prompts/models (accuracy, latency, cost)
- **Quant/data-heavy UIs** for market research & trading

I like shipping **measurable** AI: small datasets, clear evals, honest tradeoffs.

**Pinned:** fine-tune (LoRA), RAG-ERP demo, dual-AI SQL agent, AI eval bench, trading signal lab, and my VCS with dynamic views.

ðŸ“« Letâ€™s build practical AI: issues & discussions welcome.
